### LifeLeveling

LifeLeveling is a gamified self-care and personal growth application focused on helping users build positive habits through progression systems and rewards. I maintain the project repository and contribute across the backend and infrastructure, designing systems for user tracking, progression, and scalability. I also handle DevOps responsibilities, including deployment workflows and environment configuration, to ensure the project remains reliable and maintainable as it evolves.

### foolishFastAPI

foolishFastAPI is a RESTful API built in Python using FastAPI, created as a learning project to understand and implement core backend concepts. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience designing API endpoints and implementing basic CRUD operations backed by a database. The focus was on learning proper request handling, data validation, and structuring a simple but functional backend service.

### pi_sage

pi_sage is a full-stack web application developed using TypeScript and Vue.js. I maintain the repository and work across both frontend and backend development, building reactive user interfaces and integrating them with backend logic. The project focuses on clean architecture, type safety, and scalable data flow, with an emphasis on maintainability and long-term growth. The project is dockerized make it perfect for self hosting. The idea was to deploy it on a headless raspberry_pi, in conjuction with other tools that are in development.
