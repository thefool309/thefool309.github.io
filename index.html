            Hello! I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation
            in C++ and Python, and added experience in C#, HTML, and CSS. My
            dream is to carve out a niche in the world of either Game
            Development, Robotics, or Possibly another field if I found the
            right fit. Growing up, I was captivated by the creativity and
            intricate design of video games like Megaman, Link to the Past,
            Final Fantasy, and Chrono Trigger. This love for games has fueled my
            journey into software engineering, where I strive to one day blend
            technical expertise with creativity. Here, you'll find a collection
            of my projects showcasing my skills and dedication. I am committed
            to pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and further improving
            my own skills. Join me as I continue to explore, create, and find my
            niche.
