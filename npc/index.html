          This is where it all began. This project is a classic one, a character
          generator for Dungeons and Dragons. I first built this in Python back
          in 2021 when I started learning programming. At the time I planned to
          only learn Python as a hobby, but I quickly fell in love with
          programming. I decided to attend school for Computer Science, and the
          rest was history. I have built the console version of this application
          in both Python and C++. Through this application, I explored a lot of
          the basic concepts of programming and object-oriented programming. The
          Python application has a GUI version that is complete, and the C++ GUI
          version is a work in progress. NPC++ (The C++ Version) has a lot of
          source code that has yet to be fully implemented. This source shows an
          understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, Polymorphism, and
          Classes and Structs in C++.
